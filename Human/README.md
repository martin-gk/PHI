## Hardware

- LILYGO TTGO E-Paper Watch
- T-U2T Downloader

## First Steps

As this is a complete system with the e-ink display and the vibrating motor already built in all you have to do is <br>
check if everything you ordered has been shipped. <br>
Especially the T-U2T Downloader as this is necessary to connect the board to your computer.

## Connecting to your computer

Connecting to your computer is simple. Just plugin the T-U2T Downloader into the board and then both via usb to your computer. <br>
For communication it may be that you will need to download drivers. <br>
Depending on which T-U2T Downloader you get the drivers are the following. <br>

- [cp210x](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)
- [ch340k](http://wch-ic.com/products/CH340.html)
- [ch9102](http://www.wch.cn/products/CH9102.html) website is in chinese
- I found that on my newer windows machine the communication worked out of the box, without the need to install drivers

Depending on your previous experience in microcontroller you may also need to install the esp32 board to your Arduino IDE.<br>
Please refer to the following step by step guide on how to install esp32.

## Adding your hardware to the Arduino IoT cloud

This step will be covered in the cloud subsection of the project so please refer to it.

## Code

You will need to install the following extra libraries before you can compile your code.

- [Adafruit GFX](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library) this library is easier to install with the built in library manager in the IDE
- [GxEPD lewisxhe fork](https://github.com/lewisxhe/GxEPD) Please note that you will need this fork. Download it as zip and import the zip file via your library manager.
- [u8g2 by Oli Kraus](https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2) This library can also be installed from within the library manager

The complete code is in this directory, everything of importance has been commented.<br>
Please don't forget that you will also need the thingProperties.h and the arduino_secrets.h generated by the arduino cloud in the <br> same directory for the project to work.

## Troubleshooting

IF you encounter the following error on compile

```
int16_t GxFont_GFX::getUTF8Width(const char*)' cannot be overloaded
error: with 'int16_t GxFont_GFX::getUTF8Width(const char*)
```

It is an error within the GxEPD library. You will need to go into the src code of the library and alter the following two files:

- GxFont_GFX.cpp: comment or delete line 68-71 and 285-288
- GxFont_GFX.h: comment or delete line 45 and 77

The issue is a merging error that has already been reported on the respective github repository.
