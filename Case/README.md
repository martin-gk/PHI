# 3d Case

If you have built the project so far, you may want <br>
to have a case in order to wear it comfortably. <br>
The files in this directory are always the same model, <br>
I just decided to export it in different formats <br>
in order to make it accessible to a multitude of 3d printers.<br>
<br>
As for the filament I used PA, but this is not required, please <br> just use whatever you have at hand.<br>
<br>
The small slit in the back of the case is for the vibration motor to <br>
slid through in order to have skin contact. <br>
As a recommendation I secured the ESP32 board via screws to the case.
After printing there is a small modification that I recommend you do.<br>
<br>
The red circle in the following picture shows where I drilled a hole <br>
on the side to pass the cables that go into the power bank through. <br><br>
