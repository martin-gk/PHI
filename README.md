# HPI - Human Plant Interface

Project for my bachelor thesis at FH JOANNEUM - Mobile Software Development

## Introduction

The Human Plant Interface project aims to bring the user closer to his houseplants. With the help of low entry hardware components like Arduino and the IOT, I plan to enhance myself to be able to feel when my houseplants needs to be watered.

## Motivation

Cyborgs have inspired the imagination of humans since the invention of machines. From dark dystopian futures like the Terminator or the BORG from Star Trek to helpful individuals like Inspector Gadget.
Our technological advancements have moved these fantasies into the realm of reality. Although one could argue that people with prosthetic limbs count as cyborgs, it does not satisfy this SciFi notion we have when we talk about cyborgs.
The following examples do however.

- [Neil Harbisson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Harbisson) with his [Eyeborg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyeborg)
- [Moon Ribas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_Ribas) with her seismic sense
- The [North Sense](https://www.cyborgnest.net/northsense) from [Cyborg Nest](https://www.cyborgnest.net/) and their new product [Sentero](https://www.cyborgnest.net/sentero)
- [Kevin Warwick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Warwick) and his countless experiments
- Everyone involved in the [Dangerous Things](https://dangerousthings.com/) community
- [Manel de Aguas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manel_Mu%C3%B1oz) with his weather fins
- and many more

I myself am very fascinated by cyborgs and in awe of the technological possibilities at our hands. Therefore my project tries to make me a cyborg by enhancing my abilities and connecting me to a different organism - my houseplant -.

## Structure

The project is structured in three parts

- Plant
- Human
- Cloud

Plant contains all the documentation for the hardware required to connect the houseplant to the IOT
<br>
<br>
Human contains all the documentation for the wearable device
<br>
<br>
Cloud contains all the documentation for the cloud software to connect humans and plants
