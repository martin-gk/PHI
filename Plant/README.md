# Plant

## Hardware

- Arduino IOT Carrier
- Arduino MKR WIFI 1010
- Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor v1.2

## First Step

We will be building this part of the project within the Arduino environment and with the Arduino IOT Cloud, so you will need to create an account on [arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/).

After you have your account registered you need to connect the Arduino MKR WIFI 1010 onto the IOT Carrier.

Please visit the [opl√† kit website](https://opla.arduino.cc/opla/module/carrier/lesson/discovering-the-mkr-iot-carrier) for an in depth tutorial.

## Connecting to your computer

In order to be able to upload your first sketch onto your board, you will need to connect your board via USB to your computer.
You will need to download the [Arduino Create Agent](https://create.arduino.cc/getting-started/plugin/welcome) in order to recognize the Arduino boards and to read and write data from serial monitor.

You don't need an IDE to write your code, Arduino provides a very capable in-browser IDE.
